              "' \\n \\nMETAMORPHOSIS  \\nBY \\nFRANZ KAFKA  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n I \\nOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he \\nfound himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on \\nhis armour -like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his \\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. \\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off \\nany moment. His many legs, piti fully thin compared with the size of the \\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.  \\n\"What\\'s happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn\\'t a dream. His room, a \\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between \\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on \\nthe table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a \\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and \\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a f ur hat \\nand fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the \\nwhole of her lower arm towards the viewer.  \\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of \\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite  sad. \\n\"How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\", he \\nthought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was \\nused to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn\\'t get into \\nthat position. However hard he th rew himself onto his right, he always \\nrolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, \\nshut his eyes so that he wouldn\\'t have to look at the floundering legs, \\nand only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he \\nhad nev er felt before.  \\n\"Oh, God\", he thought, \"what a strenuous career it is that I\\'ve chosen! \\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much \\nmore effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that \\nthere\\'s the curse of travelling,  worries about making train connections, \\nbad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that \\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can \\nall go to Hell!\" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself  slowly \\nup on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head \\nbetter; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots \\nof little white spots which he didn\\'t know what to make of; and when he \\ntried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back \\nbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.  \\nHe slid back into his former position. \"Getting up early all the time\", he \\nthought, \"it makes you stupid. You\\'ve got to get enough sleep. Other \\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go \\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, \\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I \\nought to just try that with my boss; I\\'d get kicked o ut on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn\\'t have \\nmy parents to think about I\\'d have given in my notice a long time ago, \\nI\\'d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him \\neverything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\\'d fall right off his \\ndesk! And it\\'s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your \\ndesk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when \\nyou have to go right up close because the boss is hard of heari ng. Well, \\nthere\\'s still some hope; once I\\'ve got the money together to pay off my \\nparents\\' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that\\'s \\ndefinitely what I\\'ll do. That\\'s when I\\'ll make the big change. First of all \\nthough, I\\'ve got to get up, my  train leaves at five.\"  \\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. \\n\"God in Heaven!\" he thought. It was half past six and the hands were \\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like \\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the \\nbed that it had been set for four o\\'clock as it should have been; it \\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep \\nthrough that furniture -rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefull y, \\nbut probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do \\nnow? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would \\nhave to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not \\npacked, and he did not at all feel particularly fr esh and lively. And even \\nif he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss\\'s anger as the office \\nassistant would have been there to see the five o\\'clock train go, he \\nwould have put in his report about Gregor\\'s not being there a long time \\nago. The offic e assistant was the boss\\'s man, spineless, and with no \\nunderstanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be \\nextremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor \\nhad never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round  with \\nthe doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of \\nhaving a lazy son, and accept the doctor\\'s recommendation not to make \\nany claim as the doctor believed that no -one was ever ill but that many \\nwere workshy. And what\\'s more, would he  have been entirely wrong in \\nthis case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after \\nsleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier \\nthan usual.  \\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get \\nout of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a \\ncautious knock at the door near his head. \"Gregor\", somebody called - it \\nwas his mother - \"it\\'s quarter to seven. Didn\\'t you want to go \\nsomewhere?\" That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked whe n he heard his \\nown voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had \\nhad before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and \\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out \\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, \\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor \\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: \"Yes, mother, yes, thank -\\nyou, I\\'m getti ng up now.\" The change in Gregor\\'s voice probably could \\nnot be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was \\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short \\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,  \\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came \\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. \"Gregor, \\nGregor\", he called, \"what\\'s wrong?\" And after a short while he called \\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice:  \"Gregor! Gregor!\" At the \\nother side door his sister came plaintively: \"Gregor? Aren\\'t you well? Do \\nyou need anything?\" Gregor answered to both sides: \"I\\'m ready, now\", \\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by \\nenunciating very caref ully and putting long pauses between each, \\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister \\nwhispered: \"Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.\" Gregor, however, had \\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for \\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at \\nnight even when he was at home.  \\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being \\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only \\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he \\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in \\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps \\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out  to be pure \\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve \\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change \\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, \\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.  \\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow \\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult \\nafter that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have \\nused his arms and h is hands to push himself up; but instead of them \\nhe only had all those little legs continuously moving in different \\ndirections, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted \\nto bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch it self \\nout; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all \\nthe others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. \"This \\nis something that can\\'t be done in bed\", Gregor said to himself, \"so don\\'t \\nkeep trying to do it\".  \\nThe first t hing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of \\nthe bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine \\nwhat it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so \\nslowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he care lessly shoved \\nhimself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong \\ndirection, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at \\npresent, be the most sensitive.  \\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, \\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, \\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually \\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head.  But when he had at last got \\nhis head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if \\nhe let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so \\nhe became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. \\nAnd he coul d not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in \\nbed than lose consciousness.  \\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but \\nwhen he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they \\nstruggled against each  other even harder than before, if that was \\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this \\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay \\nin bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in \\nwhatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, \\nhe did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much \\nbetter than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this he \\nwould direct his eyes to the window and  look out as clearly as he could, \\nbut unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was \\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to \\noffer him. \"Seven o\\'clock, already\", he said to himself when the clock \\nstruck again, \" seven o\\'clock, and there\\'s still a fog like this.\" And he lay \\nthere quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected \\nthe total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.  \\nBut then he said to himself: \"Before it strike s quarter past seven I\\'ll \\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody \\nwill have come round from work to ask what\\'s happened to me as well, \\nas they open up at work before seven o\\'clock.\" And so he set himself to \\nthe task of swingin g the entire length of his body out of the bed all at \\nthe same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept \\nhis head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His \\nback seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would h appen to it \\nfalling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was \\nbound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably \\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.  \\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new \\nmethod was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock \\nback and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if \\nsomebody came to help him. Two strong people - he had his father and \\nthe maid in min d - would have been more than enough; they would only \\nhave to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away \\nfrom the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs  would \\nfind a use. Should he really call for help though, even apart from the \\nfact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, \\nhe could not suppress a smile at this thought.  \\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it  would have \\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time \\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very \\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. \"That\\'ll be someone \\nfrom work\", he said to himself , and froze very still, although his little \\nlegs only became all the more lively as they danced around. For a \\nmoment everything remained quiet. \"They\\'re not opening the door\", \\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of \\ncourse, the  maid\\'s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. \\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor\\'s first words of greeting and he \\nknew who it was - the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the \\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately \\nbecame highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all \\nemployees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was \\nfaithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience \\nthat he couldn\\'t get out of bed if he didn\\' t spend at least a couple of \\nhours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to \\nlet one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even \\nnecessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have \\nto show the who le, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only \\nthe chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? \\nAnd more because these thoughts had made him upset than through \\nany proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of  the bed. \\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn\\'t really a loud noise. His fall was \\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor\\'s back was also more elastic \\nthan he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too \\nnoticeable. He had not held his head ca refully enough, though, and hit \\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the \\ncarpet.  \\n\"Something\\'s fallen down in there\", said the chief clerk in the room on \\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had \\nhappened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you \\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this \\nquestion, the chief clerk\\'s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots \\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, \\nGregor\\'s sister whispered to him to let him know: \"Gregor, the chief \\nclerk is here.\" \"Yes, I know\", said Gregor to himself; but without daring \\nto raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.  \\n\"Gregor\", said his father now from the room to his left, \"the chief clerk \\nhas come round and wants to know why you didn\\'t leave on the early \\ntrain. We don\\'t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to \\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I\\'m sure he\\'ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.\" Then the chief \\nclerk called \"Good morning, Mr. Samsa\". \"He isn\\'t well\", said his mother \\nto the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door. \\n\"He isn\\'t well, please believe me. Why else w ould Gregor have missed a \\ntrain! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly makes me \\ncross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he\\'s been in town for a \\nweek now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen \\nand just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His idea of \\nrelaxation is working with his fretsaw. He\\'s made a little frame, for \\ninstance, it only took him two or three evenings, you\\'ll be amazed how \\nnice it is; it\\'s hanging up in his room; you\\'ll see it as soon a s Gregor \\nopens the door. Anyway, I\\'m glad you\\'re here; we wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he\\'s so stubborn; and \\nI\\'m sure he isn\\'t well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn\\'t.\" \"I\\'ll \\nbe there in a moment\", said G regor slowly and thoughtfully, but without \\nmoving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. \"Well I \\ncan\\'t think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa\", said the chief \\nclerk, \"I hope it\\'s nothing serious. But on the other hand, I must say \\nthat if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, \\nfortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it \\nbecause of business considerations.\" \"Can the chief clerk come in to see \\nyou now then?\", asked his father impatientl y, knocking at the door \\nagain. \"No\", said Gregor. In the room on his right there followed a \\npainful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.  \\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only \\njust got up and had not ev en begun to get dressed. And why was she \\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief \\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that \\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same \\ndemands as be fore? There was no need to worry about things like that \\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of \\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the \\ncarpet, and no -one who knew the condition he was in would seriousl y \\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor \\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, \\nit was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And \\nit seemed to Gregor much more sensible to le ave him now in peace \\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the others \\ndidn\\'t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse \\ntheir behaviour.  \\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, \"Mr. Samsa\", he called to him, \\n\"what i s wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more \\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary \\nconcern to your parents and you fail - and I mention this just by the \\nway - you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite \\nunheard of. I\\'m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your \\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and \\nsensible person, and now you su ddenly seem to be showing off with \\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible \\nreason for your failure to appear, it\\'s true - it had to do with the money \\nthat was recently entrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my \\nword of h onour that that could not be the right explanation. But now \\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish \\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all that \\nsecure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but \\nsince you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don\\'t see \\nwhy your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been \\nvery unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it\\'s not the time of year to do \\nespecially goo d business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time \\nof year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to \\nbe.\" \\n\"But Sir\", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the \\nexcitement, \"I\\'ll open up immediately, just a mome nt. I\\'m slightly \\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven\\'t been able to get up. I\\'m still in \\nbed now. I\\'m quite fresh again now, though. I\\'m just getting out of bed. \\nJust a moment. Be patient! It\\'s not quite as easy as I\\'d thought. I\\'m \\nquite alright now, t hough. It\\'s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a \\nperson! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, \\nperhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. \\nThey must have noticed it. I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t let you know at \\nwork! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying \\nat home. Please, don\\'t make my parents suffer! There\\'s no basis for any \\nof the accusations you\\'re making; nobody\\'s ever said a word to me \\nabout any of these things. Maybe you haven\\'t  read the latest contracts I \\nsent in. I\\'ll set off with the eight o\\'clock train, as well, these few hours of \\nrest have given me strength. You don\\'t need to wait, sir; I\\'ll be in the \\noffice soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss \\nand recommend me to him!\"  \\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was \\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily \\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed - \\nwhere he now tried to get  himself upright. He really did want to open \\nthe door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief \\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn \\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were \\nshocked then it would no longer be Gregor\\'s responsibility and he could \\nrest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no \\nreason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for \\neight o\\'clock. The first few times he tr ied to climb up on the smooth \\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one \\nlast swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in \\nserious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let \\nhimself fall ag ainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and \\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.  \\n\"Did you understand a word of all that?\" the chief clerk a sked his \\nparents, \"surely he\\'s not trying to make fools of us\". \"Oh, God!\" called \\nhis mother, who was already in tears, \"he could be seriously ill and \\nwe\\'re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!\" she then cried. \"Mother?\" his \\nsister called from the other side. They communicated across Gregor\\'s \\nroom. \"You\\'ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. \\nQuick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?\" \\n\"That was the voice of an animal\", said the chief clerk, with a calmness \\nthat was in  contrast with his mother\\'s screams. \"Anna! Anna!\" his \\nfather called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his \\nhands, \"get a locksmith here, now!\" And the two girls, their skirts \\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open  the \\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get \\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; \\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something \\nawful has happened.  \\nGregor, in contrast , had become much calmer. So they couldn\\'t \\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to \\nhim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the \\nsound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with \\nhim, and  were ready to help. The first response to his situation had \\nbeen confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he \\nhad been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the \\nlocksmith he expected great and surprising achievements - although he \\ndid not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next \\nwould be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he \\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this \\nmight well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he \\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had \\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the \\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed \\nagainst the door and listening.  \\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once \\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself \\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested \\nthere a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set \\nhimself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He \\nseemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to \\ngrasp the key? - but the lack of teeth was, of course, made u p for with a \\nvery strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key \\nturning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of \\ndamage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and \\ndripped onto the floor. \"Listen\", s aid the chief clerk in the next room, \\n\"he\\'s turning the key.\" Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: \"Well \\ndone, Gregor\", they should have cried, \"keep at it, keep hold of the \\nlock!\" And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, \\nhe bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain \\nhe was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the \\nlock with it, only holding himself uprig ht with his mouth, and hung \\nonto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body \\nas needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor\\'s \\nsign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his \\nbreath he said to h imself: \"So, I didn\\'t need the locksmith after all\". \\nThen he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.  \\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open \\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself ar ound one \\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want \\nto fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still occupied \\nwith this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, \\nwhen he heard the chief cle rk exclaim a loud \"Oh!\", which sounded like \\nthe soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to \\nthe door - his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly \\nretreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor\\'s mother, \\nher ha ir still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\\'s being there, \\nlooked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps \\nforward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts \\nthat spread themselves out around her as her head disa ppeared down \\nonto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if \\nwanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked \\nuncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and \\nwept so that his powerful chest shook.  \\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the \\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of \\nhis body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over \\nto one side as he peered out at the ot hers. Meanwhile the day had \\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey -black building on the \\nother side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite \\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its façade; \\nthe rain was st ill falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets \\nwhich hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay \\non the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor\\'s father, \\nbreakfast was the most important meal of the day and he woul d stretch \\nit out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different \\nnewspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of \\nGregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand \\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called for th respect for his \\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the \\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and \\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.  \"Now, then\", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have \\nkept calm, \"I\\'ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and \\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see\", he said to the \\nchief clerk, \"that I\\'m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a \\ncommercial travell er is arduous but without travelling I couldn\\'t earn \\nmy living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report \\neverything accurately, then? It\\'s quite possible for someone to be \\ntemporarily unable to work, but that\\'s just the right time to remember \\nwhat\\'s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the \\ndifficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more \\ndiligence and concentration. You\\'re well aware that I\\'m seriously in debt \\nto our employer as well as having  to look after my parents and my \\nsister, so that I\\'m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way \\nout of it again. Please don\\'t make things any harder for me than they \\nare already, and don\\'t take sides against me at the office. I know that \\nnobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as \\nwell as having a soft time of it. That\\'s just prejudice but they have no \\nparticular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better \\noverview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, \\na better overview than the boss himself - it\\'s very easy for a \\nbusinessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge \\nthem more harshly than he should. And you\\'re also well aware that we \\ntravellers spend almost  the whole year away from the office, so that we \\ncan very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless \\ncomplaints, and it\\'s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort \\nof thing, we don\\'t usually even hear about them, or if at all it\\'s whe n we \\narrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that\\'s when we feel the \\nharmful effects of what\\'s been going on without even knowing what \\ncaused them. Please, don\\'t go away, at least first say something to show \\nthat you grant that I\\'m at least partly righ t!\" \\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to \\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his \\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while \\nGregor was speaking, but moved steadily tow ards the door without \\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been \\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had \\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his \\nfoot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he \\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, \\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.  \\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go \\naway in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into \\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand \\nvery well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would \\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, the y had so much to \\nworry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the \\nfuture. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the \\nfuture of Gregor and his famil y depended on it! If only his sister were \\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still \\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, \\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the \\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was \\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without \\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move \\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still  might not - or \\nprobably would not - be understood, he let go of the door; pushed \\nhimself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the \\nlanding who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both \\nhands; but Gregor fell immediately over  and, with a little scream as he \\nsought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. \\nHardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to \\nfeel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under \\nthem; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even \\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon \\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held \\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as h e crouched \\nthere on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and \\nseemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly \\njumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \\n\"Help, for pity\\'s sake, Help!\" The way she held her head suggested she \\nwanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying \\nbackwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table \\nwas behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached \\nthe table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was \\ndoing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been \\nknocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.  \\n\"Mother, mother\", said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had \\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help \\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of \\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and \\ninto the arms of his father as he r ushed towards her. Gregor, though, \\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already \\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the \\nlast time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching \\nhim; t he chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down \\nseveral steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all \\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, \\nto put Gregor\\'s father into a panic as well. Until the n he had been \\nrelatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief \\nclerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, \\nGregor\\'s father seized the chief clerk\\'s stick in his right hand (the chief \\nclerk had left it behind o n a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), \\npicked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them \\nto drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went. Gregor\\'s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were s imply \\nnot understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father \\nmerely stamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the \\nchilly weather, Gregor\\'s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out \\nof it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in \\nfrom the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the \\nnewspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto \\nthe floor. Nothing would stop Gregor\\'s father as he drove him back, \\nmaking hissing noises at hi m like a wild man. Gregor had never had \\nany practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly. \\nIf Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back \\nin his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to \\ndo that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of \\na lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father\\'s hand any \\nmoment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as \\nhe saw, to his disgust, that he was quite inc apable of going backwards \\nin a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent \\nanxious glances at his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, \\nbut perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did \\nnothing to h inder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick \\nto give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only his \\nfather would stop that unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite \\nconfused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to \\nthat hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the \\nway he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head in \\nfront of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body \\nwas too broad to get throug h it without further difficulty. In his present \\nmood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the \\ndouble doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. \\nHe was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his \\nroom as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the \\ntime to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the \\ndoorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive \\nGregor forwards all the harder as if there had bee n nothing in the way; \\nit sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind \\nhim; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into \\nthe doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his \\nbody lifted itself, he lay at  an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped \\non the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks \\non it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at \\nall by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the ai r \\nwhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. \\nThen his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him \\nfrom where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep \\ninto his room. The door was slammed shut  with the stick, then, finally, \\nall was quiet.  \\nII It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from \\nhis deep and coma -like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards \\nanyway even if he hadn\\'t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep  \\nand felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps \\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully \\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone \\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and to ps of the furniture, but \\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to \\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was \\nnow beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been \\nhappening there. The whole  of his left side seemed like one, painfully \\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the \\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - it was nearly \\na miracle that only one of them had been - and dragged along life lessly.  \\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it \\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of \\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened \\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating i n it. He was so pleased he \\nalmost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that \\nmorning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly \\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in \\ndisappointment; not only did the pain  in his tender left side make it \\ndifficult to eat the food - he was only able to eat if his whole body \\nworked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all \\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had \\ncertai nly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost \\nagainst his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the \\ncentre of the room.  \\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been \\nlit in the living room. His father  at this time would normally be sat with \\nhis evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor\\'s mother, and \\nsometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. \\nGregor\\'s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but \\nmaybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all \\naround too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. \\n\"What a quiet life it is the family lead\", said Gregor to himself, and, \\ngazing into the darkness, felt a great pride t hat he was able to provide a \\nlife like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents. But what \\nnow, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible \\nand frightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to \\nthink about too  much, so he started to move about, crawling up and \\ndown the room.  \\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was \\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the \\nother side did the same; it seemed that someone  needed to enter the \\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in \\nsome way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no \\nmore that night and G regor waited in vain. The previous morning while \\nthe doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but \\nnow, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had \\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no -one came, and the \\nkeys were in the other sides.  \\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put \\nout, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed \\nawake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went \\naway toge ther on tip -toe. It was clear that no -one would come into \\nGregor\\'s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to \\nthink undisturbed about how he would have to re -arrange his life. For \\nsome reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to r emain made \\nhim feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had \\nbeen living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing other \\nthan a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It pressed \\ndown on his back a little, and  he was no longer able to lift his head, but \\nhe nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his \\nbody was too broad to get it all underneath.  \\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light \\nsleep, although he freq uently woke from it in alarm because of his \\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes \\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being \\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest \\nconsideration so  that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, \\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.  \\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as \\nearly the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister,  \\nnearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked \\nanxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she did \\nnotice him under the couch - he had to be somewhere, for God\\'s sake, \\nhe couldn\\'t have flown away - she was so shocked th at she lost control \\nof herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she \\nseemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight \\naway and came in on tip -toe as if entering the room of someone \\nseriously ill or even of a stranger. G regor had pushed his head forward, \\nright to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that \\nhe had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of \\nhunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she \\ndidn\\'t  do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention \\nto it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the \\ncouch, throw himself at his sister\\'s feet and beg her for something good \\nto eat. However, his sister noticed the ful l dish immediately and looked \\nat it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. \\nShe immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring \\nin its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have \\nguessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring. In order to \\ntest his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread \\nout on an old newspaper. There were old, half -rotten vegetables; bones \\nfrom the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a \\nfew raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible \\ntwo days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. \\nAs well as all that she  had poured some water into the dish, which had \\nprobably been permanently set aside for Gregor\\'s use, and placed it \\nbeside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor\\'s feelings, as she \\nknew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and \\neven turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could \\nmake things as comfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor\\'s little legs \\nwhirred, at last he could eat. What\\'s more, his injuries must already \\nhave completely healed as he found no difficul ty in moving. This \\namazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly \\nwith a knife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before \\nyesterday. \"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?\", he thought, \\nand was already sucki ng greedily at the cheese which had immediately, \\nalmost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on \\nthe newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with \\npleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the \\nfresh  foods, on the other hand, he didn\\'t like at all, and even dragged \\nthe things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he \\ncouldn\\'t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay \\nlethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turne d the key in the lock \\nas a sign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, \\nalthough he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the \\ncouch. But he needed great self -control to stay there even for the short \\ntime that his sister was i n the room, as eating so much food had \\nrounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that \\nnarrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his \\nsister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left -overs, \\nmixing them in w ith the food he had not even touched at all as if it \\ncould not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, \\nclosed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out. She had hardly \\nturned her back before Gregor came out again from under the co uch \\nand stretched himself.  \\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the \\nmorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the \\nsecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his \\nparents would sleep for a little w hile then as well, and Gregor\\'s sister \\nwould send the maid away on some errand. Gregor\\'s father and mother \\ncertainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have \\nbeen more than they could stand to have any more experience of his \\nfeeding tha n being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare \\nthem what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.  It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor \\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As \\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that \\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\\'s \\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was \\nonly later, when she had become a  little more used to everything - there \\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the \\nsituation - that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or \\nat least a comment that could be construed as friendly. \"He\\'s enjoyed \\nhis dinner  today\", she might say when he had diligently cleared away all \\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more \\nand more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \"now everything\\'s just \\nbeen left there again\".  \\nAlthough Gregor wasn\\'t ab le to hear any news directly he did listen to \\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard \\nanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and \\npress his whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, \\nespecially  at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in \\nsecret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about \\nwhat they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the \\nsame subject as there were always at least two members of the family at \\nhome - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of \\nthe question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day \\nthe maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor\\'s mother to let her \\ngo without delay. It was not  very clear how much she knew of what had \\nhappened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking \\nGregor\\'s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous \\nservice. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest \\nabout  what had happened, even though no -one had asked that of her.  \\nNow Gregor\\'s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; \\nalthough that was not so much bother as no -one ate very much. Gregor \\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge anoth er to eat, \\nand receive no more answer than \"no thanks, I\\'ve had enough\" or \\nsomething similar. No -one drank very much either. His sister would \\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the \\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing she \\nwould add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the \\nhousekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a \\nbig, loud \"No\", and no more would be said.  \\nEven before the first day had come to an end , his father had explained \\nto Gregor\\'s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. \\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or \\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when \\nit had collapsed five ye ars earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the \\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he \\nwanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He  \\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father\\'s business, at \\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never \\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the \\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Grego r\\'s only concern at that time \\nhad been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as \\nquickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with a \\nfiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling \\nrepresentative al most overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn \\nmoney in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work \\nstraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit \\nof his astonished and delighted family. They had been good tim es and \\nthey had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even \\nthough Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to \\nbear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They had even \\ngot used to it, both Gregor and the family , they took the money with \\ngratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer \\nmuch warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained close to his \\nsister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and \\nexpressive violinist , it was his secret plan to send her to the \\nconservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that \\nwould have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor\\'s short \\nperiods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the \\nconservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that \\ncould never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this innocent \\ntalk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let \\nthem know what he planned with a grand announcem ent of it on \\nChristmas day.  \\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind \\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening. \\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, \\nwhen his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it \\nup again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be \\nheard next door and they would all go silent. \"What\\'s that he\\'s doing \\nnow\", his father would say after a while, clearly having go ne over to the \\ndoor, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken \\nup again.  \\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, \\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these \\nmatters himself and p artly because Gregor\\'s mother did not understand \\neverything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor \\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still \\nsome money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but i t had not \\nbeen touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. \\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had \\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so \\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Be hind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. \\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\\'s \\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from \\nthat job would hav e come much closer, but now it was certainly better \\nthe way his father had done things.  \\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to \\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or \\ntwo years, no more. Tha t\\'s to say, it was money that should not really \\nbe touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be \\nearned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. \\nDuring the five years that he had not been working - the first holi day in \\na life that had been full of strain and no success - he had put on a lot of \\nweight and become very slow and clumsy. Would Gregor\\'s elderly \\nmother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and \\nit was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day \\nwould be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. \\nWould his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of \\nseventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of \\nwearing nice clothes,  sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining \\nin with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. \\nWhenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would \\nalways first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool , \\nleather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.  \\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink \\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the \\neffort of pushing a chair to the window , climbing up onto the sill and, \\npropped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. He \\nhad used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it \\nnow was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as \\nwhat he actually  saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, \\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever -present \\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, \\nand if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenst rasse, which was a \\nquiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have \\nthought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where \\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant \\nsister only needed to notice the ch air twice before she would always \\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up \\nthe room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then \\non. \\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all \\nthat she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; \\nbut as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as \\npossible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the \\nlonger it went on, of course, the better she w as able to do so, but as \\ntime went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered \\nthe room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the \\ndoor as a precaution  so that no -one would have to suffer the view into \\nGregor\\'s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it \\nhurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she \\nwould stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would \\nalarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he \\nwould stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well \\nthat she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was \\nimpossible for her to be in the  same room with him with the windows \\nclosed.  \\nOne day, about a month after Gregor\\'s transformation when his sister \\nno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, \\nshe came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still \\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most \\nhorrible. In itself, his sister\\'s not coming into the room would have been \\nno surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to \\nimmediately open the window while he was still th ere, but not only did \\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, \\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite \\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, \\nbut he had to wait unt il midday before his sister came back and she \\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she \\nstill found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she \\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little \\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to \\nspare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet \\nover to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely \\ncovered and his sister would not be able to see h im even if she bent \\ndown. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to \\ndo was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure \\nfor Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the sheet where it \\nwas. Gregor even t hought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when \\nhe carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked \\nthe new arrangement.  \\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor\\'s parents could not bring themselves \\nto come into the room to see him. He  would often hear them say how \\nthey appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, \\nbefore, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and \\nfrequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and \\nmother, would often bo th wait outside the door of Gregor\\'s room while \\nhis sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she \\nwould have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had \\neaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight  \\nimprovement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and visit \\nGregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her \\nagainst it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back b y force, which made her call \\nout: \"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can\\'t you \\nunderstand I have to see him?\", and Gregor would think to himself that \\nmaybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, \\nbut one day a w eek, perhaps; she could understand everything much \\nbetter than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after \\nall, and really might not have had an adult\\'s appreciation of the \\nburdensome job she had taken on.  \\nGregor\\'s wish to see his mot her was soon realised. Out of consideration \\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during \\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room \\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, hi s food \\nsoon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain \\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and \\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite \\ndifferent from lying on the floor; he co uld breathe more freely; his body \\nhad a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might \\nhappen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling \\nand landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of course, he had far \\nbetter  control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as \\nthat, caused himself no damage. Very soon his sister noticed Gregor\\'s \\nnew way of entertaining himself - he had, after all, left traces of the \\nadhesive from his feet as he crawled about - and got it into her head to \\nmake it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in \\nhis way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was not \\nsomething that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to \\nask for help  from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on \\nbravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped \\nin this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at \\nall times and never to have to open the door unless i t was especially \\nimportant; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when \\nGregor\\'s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. As she \\napproached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, \\nbut once at the door she went sil ent. First, of course, his sister came in \\nand looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and \\nonly then did she let her mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the \\nsheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that \\neveryt hing really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. \\nGregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; \\nhe gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad \\nthat she had come. \"You can come in, he can\\'t b e seen\", said his sister, \\nobviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too \\nheavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor \\nlistened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the \\nheaviest part of th e work for herself and ignoring her mother\\'s warnings \\nthat she would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After \\nlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be \\nbetter to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was to o heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor\\'s father got home and leaving \\nit in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for \\nanother thing it wasn\\'t even sure that taking the furniture away would \\nreally be any help to him. Sh e thought just the opposite; the sight of the \\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\\'t Gregor \\nfeel the same way about it, he\\'d been used to this furniture in his room \\nfor a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empt y \\nroom like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor \\n(whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her \\nvoice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she \\nadded \"and by taking the furniture away, won \\'t it seem like we\\'re \\nshowing that we\\'ve given up all hope of improvement and we\\'re \\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it\\'d be best to leave the \\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to \\nus again he\\'ll find everything un changed and he\\'ll be able to forget the \\ntime in between all the easier\".  \\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack \\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led \\nby the family during these two months, must  have made him confused - \\nhe could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had \\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to \\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice \\nfurniture he had inherited? Tha t would have let him crawl around \\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly \\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close \\nto forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for \\nso long, that  had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; \\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the \\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for \\nhim to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great \\nadvantage.  \\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the \\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\\'s spokesman to his \\nparents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his \\nmother\\'s advice now was sufficient reaso n for her to insist on removing \\nnot only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, \\nbut all the furniture apart from the all -important couch. It was more \\nthan childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she \\nhad recentl y acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed \\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the \\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all. Girls \\nof that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they \\nmust get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what tempted \\nGrete to make Gregor\\'s situation seem even more shocking than it was \\nso that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be the \\nonly one who would dare enter a room domi nated by Gregor crawling \\nabout the bare walls by himself.  So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor\\'s mother already \\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped \\nGregor\\'s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what stren gth she \\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without \\nif he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two \\nwomen pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than \\nGregor poked his head out from under the couch  to see what he could \\ndo about it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, \\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the \\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from \\nside to side by he rself without, of course, moving it an inch. His mother \\nwas not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so \\nGregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his \\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front \\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother\\'s attention. She \\nstood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to \\nGrete.  \\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was \\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furn iture being moved after all, \\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little \\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these \\nthings made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides. With \\nhis head a nd legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the \\nfloor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of \\nthis much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away \\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the  chest \\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove \\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk \\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, \\neven while he had been at infant school  - he really could not wait any \\nlonger to see whether the two women\\'s intentions were good. He had \\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to \\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as \\nthey stepped heavi ly on the floor.  \\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room \\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not \\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly \\ncaught by the picture on the wall  - which was already denuded of \\neverything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed in copious fur. \\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it \\nheld him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at least, now \\ntotally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no -one. He \\nturned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could \\nwatch the women when they came back.  \\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; \\nGrete had  put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. \"What shall we take now, then?\", said Grete and looked around. Her \\neyes met those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother \\nwas there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would \\nnot look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: \\n\"Come on, let\\'s go back in the living room for a while?\" Gregor could see \\nwhat Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe \\nand then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly try it! \\nHe sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at Grete\\'s face.  \\nBut Grete\\'s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to \\none side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the \\nwallpa per, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw \\nscreamed: \"Oh God, oh God!\" Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch \\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. \"Gregor!\" \\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the \\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She \\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her \\nmother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his \\npicture later, altho ugh he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself \\noff by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise \\nhis sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing \\nnothing; she was looking into various bottles, he sta rtled her when she \\nturned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut \\nGregor\\'s face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, \\nwithout delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could \\nand ran with them in t o her mother; she slammed the door shut with \\nher foot. So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of \\nhim, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not \\nwant to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; \\nthere was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety \\nand self -reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, \\nwalls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room \\nbegan to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner \\ntable.  \\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was \\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. \\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete \\nwould have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. \"What\\'s \\nhappened?\" were his first words; Grete\\'s appearance must have made \\neverything clear to him. She answered him with subd ued voice, and \\nopenly pressed her face into his chest: \"Mother\\'s fainted, but she\\'s \\nbetter now. Gregor got out.\" \"Just as I expected\", said his father, \"just \\nas I always said, but you women wouldn\\'t listen, would you.\" It was \\nclear to Gregor that Grete had  not said enough and that his father took \\nit to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible \\nfor some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to \\ncalm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him \\neven if  that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the \\nhall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and \\nwould go back into his room without delay, that it  would not be \\nnecessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door \\nand he would disappear.  \\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; \\n\"Ah!\", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and \\nglad at  the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and \\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the \\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, \\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going o n the rest of the \\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected things \\nto have changed, but still, still, was that really his father? The same \\ntired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor \\ncame back from his busin ess trips, who would receive him sitting in the \\narmchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who \\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would \\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they \\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up \\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always \\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already \\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stic k down carefully \\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his \\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; \\ndressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the \\nemployees at the banking institu te; above the high, stiff collar of the \\ncoat his strong double -chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his \\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt \\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his \\ncap, with i ts gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in \\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser \\npockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with \\nlook of determination, walked towards Gregor. He proba bly did not even \\nknow himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet \\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of \\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that - he knew full well, right from \\nthe first day of his new life,  that his father thought it necessary to \\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father, \\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he \\nmoved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several \\ntimes without anything decisive happening, without even giving the \\nimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all \\nthis time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it \\nas especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceili ng. Whatever he \\ndid, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up \\nthis running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to \\ncarry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath, \\neven in his earlier life hi s lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for \\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too \\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; \\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, \\nthey were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches \\nand protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew \\ndown and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then another one \\nimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any \\npoint in running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had \\nfilled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, \\nwithout even taking t he time for careful aim, threw one apple after \\nanother. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into \\neach other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without \\nmuch force glanced against Gregor\\'s back and slid off without doing  any \\nharm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and \\nlodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could \\nremove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but \\nhe felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in \\nconfusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled \\nopen, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her \\nblouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had \\nfainted to make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her \\nskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, \\nstumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms \\naround him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gr egor lost his ability \\nto see anything - her hands behind his father\\'s head begging him to \\nspare Gregor\\'s life.  \\nIII \\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\\'s flesh, so it \\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it \\nthere  for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough \\nto remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and \\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an \\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to sw allow any \\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.  \\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility - probably \\npermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient \\ninvalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room - \\ncrawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but this deterioration \\nin his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the \\nliving room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of closely \\nwatching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in \\nthe darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living \\nroom, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and \\nlisten to their conversation - with everyone\\'s permission,  in a way, and \\nthus quite differently from before.  They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, \\nthe ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was \\ntired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. Al l of \\nthem were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father \\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each \\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew \\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sis ter, who had taken a sales \\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be \\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake \\nup and say to Gregor\\'s mother \"you\\'re doing so much sewing again \\ntoday!\", as if he did  not know that he had been dozing - and then he \\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a \\ntired grin.  \\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor\\'s father refused to take his \\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg \\nGregor\\'s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always \\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. \\nThe uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it \\nslowly became even shabbier des pite the efforts of Gregor\\'s mother and \\nsister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole evening \\nlooking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept \\npolished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly \\nuncomforta ble but peaceful.  \\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\'s mother would speak gently to his \\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\'t \\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was \\nto be up at six to get to  work. But since he had been in work he had \\nbecome more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the \\ntable, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than \\never to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however  \\nmuch mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches \\nand warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an \\nhour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. Gregor\\'s mother would \\ntug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into hi s ear, Gregor\\'s sister \\nwould leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any \\neffect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the \\ntwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, \\nlook at them one after the other and say: \"What a life! This is what \\npeace I get in my old age!\" And supported by the two women he would \\nlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, \\nlet the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by \\nhims elf while Gregor\\'s mother would throw down her needle and his \\nsister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being \\nof help to him.  \\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give \\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an \\nenormous, thick -boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around \\nher head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; \\neverything else was looke d after by Gregor\\'s mother on top of the large \\namount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the \\nevening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several \\nitems of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though  \\nboth mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions \\nand celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat \\nwas much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move \\nout of it, there was no imaginable way of t ransferring Gregor to the new \\naddress. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons \\nthan consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it \\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with \\na few air hol es in it; the main thing holding the family back from their \\ndecision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the \\nthought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything \\nexperienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried \\nout absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, \\nGregor\\'s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother \\nsacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back \\nand forth behind her desk at the beh est of the customers, but they just \\ndid not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor\\'s \\nback began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come \\nback from taking his father to bed Gregor\\'s mother and sister would \\nnow leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to \\ncheek; his mother would point to Gregor\\'s room and say \"Close that \\ndoor, Grete\", and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in \\nthe next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit \\nthere staring dry -eyed at the table.  \\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would \\nthink of taking over the family\\'s affairs, just like before, the next time \\nthe door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief \\nclerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and \\nthe apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other \\nbusinesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender \\nmemory that appeared and disappeared again, a ca shier from a hat \\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow, - all of them \\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had \\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of \\nthem inaccessible, and he was g lad when they disappeared. Other times \\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with \\nsimple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he \\ncould think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he \\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was \\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor\\'s sister no longer thought \\nabout how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or \\nother into his room with her foot before she rus hed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away \\nagain with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or - \\nmore often than not - had been left totally untouched. She still cleared \\nup the room in the even ing, but now she could not have been any \\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there \\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the \\nworst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but \\nhe could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything \\nabout it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply \\ndecided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way \\nthat was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood \\n- cleaning up Gregor\\'s room was for her and her alone. Gregor\\'s mother \\ndid once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several \\nbucketfuls of water to do it - although that much dampness also made \\nGregor ill and he la y flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his \\nmother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly \\nhad his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change \\nin Gregor\\'s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room \\nwhere, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into \\nconvulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and \\nthe two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, \\nbecame agitated; Gregor\\'s father, stand ing to the right of his mother, \\naccused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor\\'s room to his sister; \\nfrom her left, Gregor\\'s sister screamed at her that she was never to \\nclean Gregor\\'s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, \\nwho was besid e himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, \\nquaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and \\nGregor hissed in anger that no -one had even thought of closing the door \\nto save him the sight of this and all its noise.  \\nGregor\\'s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after \\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so \\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the \\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the cha rwoman \\nwas here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made \\nher able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn\\'t really \\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real \\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Grego r\\'s room and found herself face \\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no -one was chasing \\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in \\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she \\nnever failed to open  the door slightly every evening and morning and \\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so with \\nwords that she probably considered friendly, such as \"come on then, \\nyou old dung -beetle!\", or \"look at the old dung -beetle there!\" Gr egor \\nnever responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained \\nwhere he was without moving as if the door had never even been \\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room \\nevery day instead of letting her disturb him for no reas on whenever she felt like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the \\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to \\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that \\nhe started to move toward  her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a \\nkind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one \\nof the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, \\nclearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had \\nbeen slammed down into Gregor\\'s back. \"Aren\\'t you coming any closer, \\nthen?\", she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put \\nthe chair back in the corner.  \\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find \\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take \\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and \\nthen, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was \\ndistress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had \\nsoon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of \\nputting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, \\nand there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat \\nhad been rented out to  three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen - all \\nthree of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the \\ncrack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things\\' being \\ntidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken  a \\nroom in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the \\nkitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, \\nespecially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their own \\nfurnishings and equipment with them. For thi s reason, many things \\nhad become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the \\nfamily did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into \\nGregor\\'s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there \\ntoo. The charwoman was alwa ys in a hurry, and anything she couldn\\'t \\nuse for the time being she would just chuck in there. He, fortunately, \\nwould usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it. \\nThe woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when \\nshe had  time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, \\nbut what actually happened was that they were left where they landed \\nwhen they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through \\nthe junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved  it because, \\nwith no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, \\nbut later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that the way \\nleft him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours \\nafterwards.  \\nThe gentlemen who r ented the room would sometimes take their \\nevening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and \\nso the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But \\nGregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, \\noften failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family \\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, \\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rent ed the room came in \\nin the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where, \\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they \\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor\\'s \\nmother immediately app eared in the doorway with a dish of meat and \\nsoon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. \\nThe food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The \\ngentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to \\ntest the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who \\nseemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a \\npiece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish \\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether  it should be sent back to \\nthe kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\\'s mother and sister, \\nwho had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.  \\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor\\'s father \\ncame into the l iving room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once \\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen \\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once \\nthey were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed rem arkable \\nto Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth \\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need \\nteeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with \\njaws that are toothless howeve r nice they might be. \"I\\'d like to eat \\nsomething\", said Gregor anxiously, \"but not anything like they\\'re eating. \\nThey do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\"  \\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the \\nviolin being played, but t his evening it began to be heard from the \\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in \\nthe middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the \\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and \\nsmoking. Wh en the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up \\nand went on tip -toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood \\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the \\nkitchen, as Gregor\\'s father called out: \"Is the playing perhaps  \\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.\" \"On the \\ncontrary\", said the middle gentleman, \"would the young lady not like to \\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much \\nmore cosy and comfortable?\" \"Oh yes, we\\'d l ove to\", called back Gregor\\'s \\nfather as if he had been the violin player himself. The gentlemen \\nstepped back into the room and waited. Gregor\\'s father soon appeared \\nwith the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the \\nviolin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his \\nparents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed \\nan exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare \\nto sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with  his \\nright hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - \\nleaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out \\nof the way in a corner.  \\nHis sister began to p lay; father and mother paid close attention, one on \\neach side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, \\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in \\nthe living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerat e he \\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so \\nthoughtless about the others. What\\'s more, there was now all the more \\nreason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay \\neverywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he \\ncarried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; \\nhe was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and \\nwipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. \\nAnd despite this condition, he  was not too shy to move forward a little \\nonto the immaculate floor of the living room.  \\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with \\nthe violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in \\ntheir pockets and come up f ar too close behind the music stand to look \\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor\\'s \\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the \\nwindow with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume,  \\nand they stayed by the window while Gregor\\'s father observed them \\nanxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to \\nhear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been \\ndisappointed, that they had had enough of the whole pe rformance and \\nit was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be \\ndisturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke \\nfrom their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor\\'s \\nsister was playing so beautif ully. Her face was leant to one side, \\nfollowing the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. \\nGregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the \\nground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an \\nanimal i f music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was \\nbeing shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been \\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister \\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with  her \\nviolin, as no -one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He \\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his \\nshocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he \\nwanted to be at every door of his room at o nce to hiss and spit at the \\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but \\nstay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her \\near bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to \\nsend her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it \\nlast Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if this \\nmisfortune hadn\\'t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break o ut in tears of \\nemotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, \\nwhich, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without \\nany necklace or collar.  \\n\"Mr. Samsa!\", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor\\'s father, \\npointing, wit hout wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor \\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the \\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and \\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think i t more \\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even \\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more \\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them \\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to  drive them back into their \\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his \\nbody. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear \\nwhether it was his father\\'s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning \\nrealisation that they  had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room \\nwithout knowing it. They asked Gregor\\'s father for explanations, raised \\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back \\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor\\'s sister  had \\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was \\nsuddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and \\nbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still \\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the \\ninstrument on her mother\\'s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for \\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under \\npressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly \\nmoving toward. Under his sister\\'s experi enced hand, the pillows and \\ncovers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already \\nfinished making the beds and slipped out again before the three \\ngentlemen had reached the room. Gregor\\'s father seemed so obsessed \\nwith what he was doing tha t he forgot all the respect he owed to his \\ntenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already \\nat the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like \\nthunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor\\'s father to a \\nhalt. \"I declare here and now\", he said, raising his hand and glancing at \\nGregor\\'s mother and sister to gain their attention too, \"that with regard \\nto the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family\" \\n- here he looked briefly but decisiv ely at the floor - \"I give immediate \\nnotice on my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of \\ncourse, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to \\nproceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me \\nit wou ld be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.\" He was \\nsilent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And \\nindeed, his two friends joined in with the words: \"And we also give \\nimmediate notice.\" With that, he took hold of the door handle and \\nslammed the door.  Gregor\\'s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his \\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for \\nhis usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept \\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all \\nthis, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. \\nHis disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because \\nhe was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to  move. He was \\nsure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He \\nwas not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother\\'s \\nlap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.  \\n\"Father, Mother\", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as \\nintroduction, \"we can\\'t carry on like this. Maybe you can\\'t see it, but I \\ncan. I don\\'t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we \\nhave to try and get rid of it. We\\'ve done all that\\'s humanly possible to \\nlook after it and be patient, I don\\'t think anyone could accuse us of \\ndoing anything wrong.\"  \\n\"She\\'s absolutely right\", said Gregor\\'s father to himself. His mother, who \\nstill had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her \\nhand held out in fro nt of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.  \\nGregor\\'s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. \\nHer words seemed to give Gregor\\'s father some more definite ideas. He \\nsat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left b y the \\nthree gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at \\nGregor as he lay there immobile.  \\n\"We have to try and get rid of it\", said Gregor\\'s sister, now speaking only \\nto her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, \\n\"it\\'ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can\\'t all work \\nas hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we \\ncan\\'t endure it. I can\\'t endure it any more.\" And she broke out so \\nheavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she \\nwiped them away with mechanical hand movements.  \\n\"My child\", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, \\n\"what are we to do?\"  \\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and \\ntears that had taken h old of her, displacing her earlier certainty.  \\n\"If he could just understand us\", said his father almost as a question; \\nhis sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of \\nthat there was no question.  \\n\"If he could just understand us\", rep eated Gregor\\'s father, closing his \\neyes in acceptance of his sister\\'s certainty that that was quite impossible, \"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement \\nwith him. But as it is ...\"  \\n\"It\\'s got to go\", shouted his sister, \"that\\'s the only way, Father. You\\'ve \\ngot to get rid of the idea that that\\'s Gregor. We\\'ve only harmed ourselves \\nby believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it were Gregor he \\nwould have seen long ago that it\\'s not possible for human beings to live \\nwith an animal like  that and he would have gone of his own free will. \\nWe wouldn\\'t have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with \\nour lives and remember him with respect. As it is this animal is \\npersecuting us, it\\'s driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to tak e \\nover the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. Father, look, \\njust look\", she suddenly screamed, \"he\\'s starting again!\" In her alarm, \\nwhich was totally beyond Gregor\\'s comprehension, his sister even \\nabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vi gorously out of her chair \\nas if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near \\nGregor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited \\nmerely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of \\nGregor\\'s sister as if to protect her.  \\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his \\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go \\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his \\npain-wracked condition mea nt that turning round required a great deal \\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly \\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked round. \\nThey seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been \\nalarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. His \\nmother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against \\neach other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to \\nhis father with her arms around his neck.  \\n\"Maybe now they\\'ll let me turn round\", thought Gregor and went back \\nto work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had \\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No -one was making him rush any \\nmore, everything was left up to him. As soon as he had f inally finished \\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the \\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not \\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little \\nwhile before and almost without notici ng it. He concentrated on \\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a \\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his \\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way \\nround as he felt hi s neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough \\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood \\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen \\ncompletely asleep.  He was hardly inside his room before the door was h urriedly shut, \\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that \\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so \\nmuch of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung \\nforward lightly, Gregor had not h eard her coming at all, and as she \\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents \"At last!\".  \\n\"What now, then?\", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the \\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at \\nall. This was no  surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to \\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was \\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire \\nbody was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weak er and \\nweaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly \\nfeel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which \\nwas entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his family with \\nemotion and love. If it was possib le, he felt that he must go away even \\nmore strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of empty and \\npeaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the \\nmorning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside \\nthe wi ndow too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down \\ncompletely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.  \\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning - they\\'d often asked her \\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in h er hurry \\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she\\'d arrived and \\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she made her usual \\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought \\nhe was laying there so still on p urpose, playing the martyr; she \\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be \\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it \\nfrom the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to \\nmake a nuisance of h erself and poked at him a little, and only when she \\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did \\nshe start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really happened, \\nopened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not wast e time to \\nyank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the \\nbedrooms: \"Come and \\'ave a look at this, it\\'s dead, just lying there, \\nstone dead!\"  \\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to \\nmake an effort to get o ver the shock caused by the cleaner before they \\ncould grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, \\nthey hurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his \\nshoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how \\nthey wen t into Gregor\\'s room. On the way they opened the door to the \\nliving room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen \\nhad moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, \\nand the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. \"Dead ?\", asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she \\ncould have checked for herself and could have known it even without \\nchecking. \"That\\'s what I said\", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she \\ngave Gregor\\'s body another shove with t he broom, sending it sideways \\nacross the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold \\nback the broom, but did not complete it. \"Now then\", said Mr. Samsa, \\n\"let\\'s give thanks to God for that\". He crossed himself, and the three \\nwomen followed h is example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from \\nthe corpse, said: \"Just look how thin he was. He didn\\'t eat anything for \\nso long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in\". \\nGregor\\'s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not \\nseen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did \\nhe do anything to make them look away.  \\n\"Grete, come with us in here for a little while\", said Mrs. Samsa with a \\npained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom b ut not \\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened \\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air \\nhad something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of \\nMarch, after all.  \\nThe three gentleme n stepped out of their room and looked round in \\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. \"Where \\nis our breakfast?\", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. \\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign  to \\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor\\'s room. They did so, \\nand stood around Gregor\\'s corpse with their hands in the pockets of \\ntheir well -worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.  \\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appea red in his \\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of \\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face \\nagainst her father\\'s arm.  \\n\"Leave my home. Now!\", said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and \\nwithout letting th e women from him. \"What do you mean?\", asked the \\nmiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled \\nsweetly. The other two held their hands behind their backs and \\ncontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud \\nquarrel wh ich could only end in their favour. \"I mean just what I said\", \\nanswered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight \\nline towards the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground \\nas if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new \\npositions. \"Alright, we\\'ll go then\", he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa \\nas if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted \\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely \\nopened his eyes wide and briefly no dded to him several times. At that, \\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front \\nhallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumped \\noff after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa \\nmight go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection \\nwith their leader. Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, \\ntook their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the \\npremises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the \\nlanding; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men\\'s intentions \\nand as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen \\nmade slow but steady progress down the m any steps. As they turned \\nthe corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few \\nmoments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa \\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher\\'s boy, proud of posture \\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer \\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing \\nand went, as if relieved, back into the flat.  \\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation \\nand to go for a walk; not only h ad they earned a break from work but \\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote three \\nletters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her \\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they \\nwere writ ing to tell them she was going, she\\'d finished her work for that \\nmorning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from \\nwhat they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not \\nseem to want to leave that they looked up in irr itation. \"Well?\", asked \\nMr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her \\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only \\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather \\non her hat, which  had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the \\ntime she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. \\n\"What is it you want then?\", asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had \\nthe most respect for. \"Yes\", she answered, and broke into a frien dly \\nlaugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \"well then, that \\nthing in there, you needn\\'t worry about how you\\'re going to get rid of it. \\nThat\\'s all been sorted out.\" Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their \\nletters as if intent on continuing wit h what they were writing; Mr. \\nSamsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in \\ndetail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was \\nnot to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she \\nsuddenly remember ed what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, \\ncalled out \"Cheerio then, everyone\", turned round sharply and left, \\nslamming the door terribly as she went.  \\n\"Tonight she gets sacked\", said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply \\nfrom either his wife or his daug hter as the charwoman seemed to have \\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went \\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each \\nother. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat \\nthere watching f or a while. Then he called out: \"Come here, then. Let\\'s forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of \\nattention\". The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to \\nhim where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quick ly \\nfinished their letters.  \\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something \\nthey had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open \\ncountry outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm \\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they \\ndiscussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they \\nwere not at all bad - until then they had never asked each other about \\ntheir work but all three had jobs which were very good and held \\nparticula rly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for \\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving \\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper \\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in \\na better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete was \\nbecoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her \\ncheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. \\nSamsa were struck, almost simu ltaneously, with the thought of how \\ntheir daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young \\nlady. They became quieter. Just from each other\\'s glance and almost \\nwithout knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good \\nman for her . And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good \\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first \\nto get up and stretch out her young body.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '"

It showed a lady fitted out with a f ur hat \\nand fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the \\nwhole of her lower arm towards the viewer.  \\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

He must have tried it a hundred times, \\nshut his eyes so that he wouldn\\'t have to look at the floundering legs, \\nand only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he \\nhad nev er felt before.  \\n\"Oh, God\", he thought, \"what a strenuous career it is that I\\'ve chosen! \\nTravelling day in and day out.

Gregor's condition also affects his job as a traveling salesman and he is eventually fired. In the end, Gregor dies and his family feels a sense of relief and freedom. His transformation is seen as a symbol of his family's dysfunction and the dehumanizing effects of modern society.\"\n",
